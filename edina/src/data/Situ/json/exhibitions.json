            "Judge's Comments: \"Eureka! A painting filled with all my favorite wow factors: an exciting composition, energetic brushwork, and a full color palette. It appears the artist connected with the scene and merely brushed on emotion laden spots of color to express it. The painting then came together on its own, very Charles Hawthorne-esque in approach. I particularly like the bold diagonal lead in strokes juxtaposed with the vertical dwelling and hilltop reflections, the strong lights and darks, cools and warms and the seemingly innocuous but important minuscule strokes forming the wired telephone poles and the distant red sailboat\".
